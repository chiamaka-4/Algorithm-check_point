# Algorithm-check_point


    this algorithm is an array with an integer and boolean as its variable. Its a card sorting which has been initializes to false. it states that fro 0 to the length of cards,do. if the cards array is greater than then cards lenght will increment by 1 each time the card loop through. the output will be stored in a variable. in this case, each time the card increment, it will be assigned to true
